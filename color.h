/*                             XYZ_TO_RGB

    Given an additive tricolour system CS, defined by the CIE x
    and y chromaticities of its three primaries (z is derived
    trivially as 1-(x+y)), and a desired chromaticity (XC, YC,
    ZC) in CIE space, determine the contribution of each
    primary in a linear combination which sums to the desired
    chromaticity.  If the  requested chromaticity falls outside
    the Maxwell  triangle (colour gamut) formed by the three
    primaries, one of the r, g, or b weights will be negative. 

    Caller can use Constrain_rgb() to desaturate an
    outside-gamut colour to the closest representation within
    the available gamut and/or Norm_rgb to normalise the RGB
    components so the largest nonzero component has value 1.
